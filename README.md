# Fungal UI
### A lightweight UI framework for console-based applications

## About

Fungal UI is a simple library, made mostly for fun, to create UIs in console-based C++ applications. Navigation is performed
with the arrow keys and with the tab key, as opposed to the mouse; though one could reasonably extend the project to handle
mouse events as well. 

## Building

The project uses C++17 and has no external dependencies.
